# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise's own play called "Fever" has came close to the goal established in quick time. The purpose of this project is to help give Louise insight on how similar theater and play campaigns succeded, failed, or even cancelled based on their launch date and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
#### Pivot Table
The first step to find out the outcomes based on launch date is to create a pivot table. A pivot table is useful in this instance because it can provide a summary of our data and give us insight based on the data we use.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
