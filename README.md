# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise's own play called "Fever" has came close to the goal established in quick time. The purpose of this project is to help give Louise insight on how similar theater and play campaigns succeded, failed, or even canceled based on their launch date and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
#### Pivot Table
The first step to find out the outcomes based on launch date is to create a pivot table. A pivot table is useful in this instance because it can provide a summary of our data and give us insight based on the data we use.

Looking at the Pivot table, the information on how many campaign were successful, failed, and canceled on a monthly basis is showned. Additionally, this pivot table is filtered to only show the campaigns that are only of the theater category. To get a better understanding of the table, creating a visual graph can help see trends and any other findings.

The graph shown above provide information on trends of campaigns results on a monthly basis.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The next analysis that was performed was on the outcomes based on goals. The objective of this analysis was to count the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns based on the goal amount of the campaign. By using the excel function `COUNTIF()`, it performs conditional checks to count only the campaigns that fits the parameter given. In this case, the goal range and the sub-category "plays".

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
